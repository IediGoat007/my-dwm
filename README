My custom dwm config.

Im writing this here as a jurnal lol, but yeah im getting kind of bored of having to tweak so many stuff and it still 
barely working and now knowing if its nvidia or picom or how dwm fundamentally works or some patch my dumbass applied 
or even debian because for some reason i like more bleeding edge stuff and im using sid.

Fact is at the beggining it was really fun and everything worked and of course i loved it more than any de you can
find out there, but with time stuff got upgraded and started having some problems that are simply way out of my
league to solve, that i had to fix with the stupidest method because i couldnt do more than that, but still it was
ok and i enjoyed using my config even tho i made it very specific to my current setup and thats gonna hurt later.

But i really want now to get a little more into gaming (i slowed down a lot with it since 1st getting linux) and
this plain simple debian just aint my attraction anymore for that, so here i am writing this thing before i 
hop on to nobara hoping that im gonna get a simpler, less buggier experience. But well, if it wont work i will 
probably come back here but use the trusty stable debian and not complicate my life with all kinds of shit, in
wich case this dwm config will be once again my lovely home and i will be proud knowing that bad as it looks
(the code i mean), at least its mine and i was the one assigning my own values to variables and i spent 1 whole
day manually patching the source file, gosh what a pain that was given my almost 0 coding expertise.

Also honorable mention to Chris Titus for inspiring me to switch to linux and later to dwm, dude you are 
just great.

no one will ever see this lol why am i even writing
